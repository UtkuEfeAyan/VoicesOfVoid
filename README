there were too many words to do by hand in the vocabulary.json file so here is the link for the chat 
I, at the end of the chat, decided to lower the amount of words since the words were too complex 
 The generation looked bad, and didn't make sense in translation

the directions controls of language creation is currently not perfect.

Postmortem(did use gramerly for grammer sice i have a subscription
I think i bit off more than I could chew with some stuff, especially my original idea of having both a custom glyp generator that would generate glyphs for each of the  genrated languages
as i started working on it and doing more research on word generation, sentence generation, conlanging(creating languages) etc. I realized how complicated things were
so I decided to only focus on teh language part of the thing rather than the glyph generation so i ditched graphic glyph generation to just start using different pre-made letters and more
exotic alphabet characters integration rather than generation form zero. condensing my efforts helped alot however, the ui, style.css and HTML parts took a very long time, especially the html
since I'm not really good at html even though i have like ideated by using ChatGPT, for, templates/templates it couldn't do waht I wanted fully  so I needed to tweak and fix stuff  a lot 
espacially for moving parts like sentence genrator and  the dictionaries that hold my generated sentences, which I did, made some cool drop-down selection menus and a good interfeca
and it became one of the parts I'm very proud of in the project even though they are not perfect, they are very good(at least ithink so). 

Then we have the main problem generation logicwhich I thought would be easy since i had so many rules right it wasn't well at leanst it wasnt a sgood as i hoped it would be, 
It's a thousand times better than where it started, especially for generating sentences and words and like follows all teh rules(i think) however, it still cant really generate authantic feeling 
words I mean it does generate words, but they dont look liek teh ones we see in English, where they are very clearly structured but that semi-random genration for you i spent a lot of time 
Looking for language generation logic and algorithms online; however, everything i found was not something I like, where they were using outer apis or logic so complex taht i had no idea 
What it was doing even  after watching teh videos or reding about them, Markov chains, however, the easy way people used them was not really compatible with my other rule based logic
I wanted to use as withy were just using outside libraries or APIs(markovify) to generate text from nothing, but I wanted to control how the text would be generated but
I couldn't get them to work as they were a completely new topic for me and was way more complex than i thought and i probably shouldn't have wasted time trying to learn how to make them work 
the way i wanted (work together with my rule based logic) which I realized was futile so I realized i needed ot be to be content with this level of generation It's not bad persay but not the
Perfect one I wanted, still it works and looks relatively ok so it's good but like I said generation was the hardest part to get right.
